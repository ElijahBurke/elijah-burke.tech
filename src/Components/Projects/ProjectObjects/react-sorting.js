const desc = `This is a project that displays a visual representation of 5 sorting algorithms built in react.
These algorithms are insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort and quick sort.
Working on this was a great chance to practice working with react as well as writing complex algorithms, not only in an efficient way but one that we can animate.`;
